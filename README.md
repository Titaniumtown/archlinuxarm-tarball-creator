# Arch Linux Arm Raspberry Pi 4 Tarball creator
This repo contains scripts to create tarballs that use my Arch Linux Arm repo (that contains [updated Raspberry Pi 4 kernel packages](https://github.com/Titaniumtown/raspi4_pkgbuilds), and ZFS packages, among other things). This also gets you running with a fully functioning system very quickly, with everything installed, networking, time, ssh, and more working out of the box and requiring no extra setup.

You can get builds at: https://www.gardling.com/arch-raspi4-tarballs

This project is based off of the work I did for: [InstantOS-arm](https://github.com/instantOS/instantOS-arm)
