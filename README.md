# instantOS arm
For a Raspberry Pi 4, you can mostly follow this [Installation Guide](https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv8/broadcom/raspberry-pi-4).

## Todo:
https://github.com/instantOS/instantOS-arm/projects/1

## Supported hardware:
https://github.com/instantOS/instantOS-arm/projects/2

## Where to download?
http://www.gardling.com/instantos-arm
There is both a full and lite version of the tarball. The full version has instantWM with all the instantos programs for a fully functional desktop. The lite version is without any desktop environment, but still has it in the repo. 

## Other approaches
If you are a fan of the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org), you may want to try [instantNIX](https://github.com/instantOS/instantNIX) with [Raspi 4B instructions](https://github.com/instantOS/instantNIX/wiki/instantNIX-on-a-Raspberry-Pi-4B) (not the recommended way).
